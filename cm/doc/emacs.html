<h1>Running Common Music under X/Emacs</h1>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>
and <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a> editors (collectively
referred to as X/Emacs in this document) support Lisp editing and
evaluation within a single, consistent GUI environment.  This tight
integration between Lisp editing and evaluation lets the composer
develop music programs (Lisp expressions) inside a powerful program
editor and also <em>evaluate</em> these Lisp expressions inside Common
Music using simple editor commands. The Common Music application runs
in its own dedicated Listener window as an <em>inferior process</em>
(sub-process) of X/Emacs. This Listener window is itself a
full-featured, interactive Lisp interpreter with its own command
history and input editing features.
</p>

<p>
The whole point of running Common Music inside X/Emacs is to integrate
Lisp editing and evaluation in a single, easy-to-use graphical
environment. So if your system already has an Emacs editor installed
on it, make sure that it provides a windowed, GUI version of the
editor!  Some older installations of Emacs run the editor in what is
called <em>console mode</em>, directly inside the command shell window
without a GUI or mouse support.  If your installed Emacs is old (prior
to the 21.3 branch) or doesn't support a GUI then don't bother using
it, simply follow the links provided below to download and install a
newer version for your system.
</p>

<H2>Installing X/Emacs</H2>

<p>
Which editor you choose to install and work with is really a matter of
personal taste.  Both editors are free, provide the same basic editing
services, and run on practically every operating system available
today. The primary difference between the two applications lies in
their divergent GUI designs. Without commenting on which design is
"better", it is probably fair to say that the typical user will feel
most comfortable in an editor whose behavior is consistent with the
host operating system's native window manager. On Linux, Cygwin and
Windows this is XEmacs, on OS X it is probably an <em>Aqua</em> Emacs.
<p>

<h3>Downloading distributions</h3>

<p>
<em>Regardless of which editor you choose, install a recent (21.3.1 or
later), stable, fully-configured distribution that includes all elisp
sources</em>. (X)Eamcs distributions typically consist of several
parts: the core editor, the Emacs Lisp (elisp) source files, and lots
of add-on packages.  The size of a fully configured distribution is
very large, between 20 and 30 megabytes for a binary release depending
on the editor and operating system involved.  Even if downloading will
require up to several hours (on a 56k modem, for example), you should
take whatever time necessary to install a fully configured
X/Emacs. You are certain to use more and more features and add-on
packages as you gain familiarity with the editor.
</p>

<h4>Suggested binary distributions for running Common Music</h4>

<p>
Common Music has been tested in the most recent stable releases of the
following distributions:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Linux:</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html">XEmacs for X</a>
</dd>

<dt>OS X:</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://www.mindlube.com/products/emacs/">Emacs for OS X</a>
(Aqua)
</dd>

<dt>Windows 2000/XP: </dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/">XEmacs for Windows</a>
(Cygwin install also available on the same page.)
</dd>

<dt>MacOS: </dt>
<dd>
MCL's editor (Fred) is an acceptible Emacs substitute. (The name Fred
stands for Fred Resembles Emacs Deliberately.)
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Customizing X/Emacs</h3>
<p>
Once you have downloaded and installed X/Emacs you can customize it
for working with Common Music and programming in Lisp:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Start X/Emacs</li>

<li>
Select Syntax Highlighting from the Options menu at the top of the
Emacs window.  If Syntax Highlighting has a submenu, make sure that
its Automatic feature is checked in the submenu.
</li>

<li>
Select Save Options from the Options menu. X/Emacs then prompts you to
confirm saving ~/.emacs or .xemacs/init.el.  Type 'y' to confirm.
</li>

<!-- li>Once you have saved the options, quit X/Emacs by selecting
Quit from the File menu, or start learning about the editor using the
interactive Emacs Tutorial located in the Help menu (or via the
keyboard command <b><u>C-h</u> t</b>.)
</li -->
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Saving the customized options creates or updates your personal
<em>emacs initialization file</em> which X/Emacs loads each time it
starts. You can add your own Emacs commands (elisp expressions) to
this file to set up the editor exactly the way you want it.  <!-- By
defualt, X/Emacs saves your initialization file in your <em>home
directory</em>. On a Unix-flavor machine, your home directory is your
login directory. On a Windows machine the home directory may be a
login directory or it may be the root directory of the file system,
for example C:\. Regardless of what operating system you use, X/Emacs
lets you specify your home directory using the Unix ~/ convention.
Emacs and XEmacs name the initialization file differently.  --> XEmacs
normally saves the init file as ~/.xemacs/init.el, that is, the file
init.el in the .xemacs subdirectory of your home folder. Emacs uses
~/.emacs, the file .emacs located in your home directory. (On Unix
machines the dotted names -- .xemacs/ and .emacs -- make the init file
"invisible" in normal directory listings and browser windows but you
can always open it in X/Emacs)

<!-- The dotted names -- .xemacs/ and .emacs -- make the init file
"invisible" in normal directory listings on Unix machines.  For
example, if you display the content of your home direcotory using
<code>ls ~/</code> on Linux neither .emacs or .xemacs/ will appear in
the listing.  Similarly, OS X these files never appear in the Finder
window.  On Windows, however, the dotted names will be visible in
normal Command Shell listings and in Folder windows -->

</p>

<h3>Learning Emacs</h3>

<p>
X/Emacs can work just like any other mouse-driven, point-and-click
text editor. However, the real power (and beauty) of X/Emacs lies in
its <em>keyboard commands</em> -- short, simple keystrokes that invoke
the powerful editing, formatting and cursor moving features of the
editor. If you want to become an efficient Lisp composer you should
spend several hours (or even days!) becomimg familiar with X/Emacs
keyboard commands and the advanced features of the editor. Here are

Emacs' interactive Tutorial, available from the Emacs Help menu or by  the command
<b><u>C-h</u> t</b> (type control-h followed by t).

<h2>Running Common Music under X/Emacs</h2>

<p>
The remainng sections of this document assume that you have already
downloaded Common Music and can start a GUI X/Emacs on your
system. See the document <a href="install.html">Installing Common
Music</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Quickstart (Linux, OS X, Cygwin)</h3>

<p>

the easiest way to start CM under X/Emacs on Linux and OSX is to pass
your editor command to the bin/cm.sh script.  Here are several
examples on different systems. Each example assumes that you have
already used the <code>cd</code> command to change to the Common Music
installation directory:
</p>

<div class="float">
<p class="captxt">Starting CM under xemacs on Linux:</p>
<pre class="shell">% <span class="input">bin/cm.sh -e xemacs</span></pre>
</div>

<div class="float">
<p class="captxt">Starting CM under /Application/Emacs.app on OS X:</p>
<pre class="shell">% <span class="input">bin/cm.sh -e Emacs</span></pre>
</div>

<div class="float">
<p class="captxt">Starting CM in Guile under Emacs on Cygwin:</p>
<pre class="shell">$ <span class="input">bin/cm.sh -l guile -e emacs</span></pre>
</div>

<p>
See the <a href="dict/cm-sh.html"><code>cm.sh</code> documentation</a>
for more information about using the script to run Common Music.
</p>

<h3>Running CM in X/Emacs under Windows</h3>

<p>
You cannot start CM using cm.sh in a Windows command interpreter.
However, you can add code to your personal X/Emacs init file that
will accomlish bascially the same thing. The following instructions
assume that you have a system-wide command/batch file that starts your
Lisp implementation, and that you have already installed CM using it.
For more information on these topics see aaaa .
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Locate the file cm.bat located in the bin/ subdirectory of the Common
Music installation directory.
</li>

<li>
Verify that you can start cm running with this bat file in the Windows
command interpreter:

<ol>
<li>
Select Run Command from the Start menu, or type Windows-R (press the
Windows key and then type R).
</li>

<li>Type CMD in thetypin box.</li>

<li>
Change directories to the bin/ subdirectory under the Common Music
installation directory.
</li>

<li>Type <code>cm</code> to start Common Music.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>
Follow the instructions in <a href="#cm-emacs-initfile">Starting
Common Music from inside X/Emacs</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="cm-emacs-initfile">Starting Common Music from inside X/Emacs</h3>

Here is how to start Common Music from within a running X/Emacs:

<ol>

<li>
Add the following two forms to your X/Emacs init file and change the
value of <code>cm-pathname</code> to the actual directory path to
Common Music's installation directory on your machine.  Use the / Unix
directory delimiter even if you are on Windows.  If you are
<em>not</em> on Windows then change cm.bat to cm.sh as well.

<div class="float">
<p class="captxt">Loading CM's listener into X/Emacs on Windows.
</p>
<pre class="code"><span style="color: blue;">;;; Edit the cm-directory string to point to the
;;; CM installation directory on your machine.</span>

(<span class="special">defvar</span> <span class="defined">cm-directory</span> <span class="string">"C:/Lisp/cm-2.4.1"</span>)

(<span class="special">let*</span> ((els (concat cm-directory <span class="string">"/etc/xemacs"</span>))
       (bin (concat cm-directory <span class="string">"/bin/cm.bat"</span>))
       (load-path (list* els load-path)))
  (load <span class="string">"listener"</span>)
  (load <span class="string">"cm.el"</span>)
  (setq inferior-lisp-program bin))</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>Save the changes and quit (X)emacs.</li>

<li>
Restart X/Emacs, then type <b><u>C-x</u> l</b> to start the listener.
(Press the control key down and type the x key, then release both keys
together, then type the l key).  Alternately, you can set the current
buffer into Lisp-mode (<b><u>M-x</u> lisp-mode</b>) and select Lisp Listener from
the Listner menu that appears in the menu bar.
</li>
</ol>
