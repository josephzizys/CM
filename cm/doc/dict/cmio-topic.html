<p>
The CMIO (Common Music Input/Output) window is a graphical tool for
generating musical event data to and from sound synthesis and display
applications. The intial contents of the window's various tabbed pages
can be preset by passing field values to the <a href="cmio-fn.html">cmio
function</a> when the window is created. Since the target pages and
the window's Systems and Files pages allows these systems be
dynamically configured and loaded into Common Music. 

<h2>Window Layout</h2>

<p>
The CMIO window is divided into four main components:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>Sources</em> frame holds tabbed <em>pages</em> that relate
to creating and generating event data.</li>

<li>A <em>Targets</em> frame holds tab pages related to sound sysnthesis and
display configurations.
</li>
<li>
An <em>Executive</em> frame manages the system's working directory and current
input/output file. <!-- The Execute button triggers actions on files
according to user-defined semantics. -->
</li>
<li>A message line displays information related to the ongoing tasks
executed inside the window.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each tabbed page contains a set of <em>fields</em> representing the
input/output features of a given application. The right-justified
pages relate to more general features in the window or Lisp environment.

<h3>Colorized Fields </h3>
A few coloration rules provide additional information about how fields on a page work:
<ul>
<li>Blue labels mark <em>required</em> fields that must contain infomation
before the page can execute.
</li>

<li>
Yellow backgrounds indicate fields that will be
<em>evaluated</em> when the information is accessed.
</li>

<li>
White backgrounds indicate fields that should contain plain text or
are <em>read</em> to produce a Lisp value. It is possible to force
evaluation in a white field by using the special #.<em>expr </em>
notation, where <em>expr</em> is an expression to be evaluated for
the contents of the field.
</li>

<li>
The Message line uses syntax highlighting to classify the type
of message displayed: green represents a normal message or
sucessful completion of a command, yellow indicates a warning
or notification, red signifies an error condition.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error handling and notification</h3>
<p>
A CMIO window simply facilitates tasks that would otherwise be
accomplished by evaluating expressinos in the Lisp interpreter.  As
such, its actions and data specification are all accplished using the
normal Lisp.  However, the windnow itself accomplishes its task via
GTK <em>callbacks</em> which involves the (foreign) execution of Lisp
code. Generating Lisp errors under foreign callbacks is generally a
bad thing because the Lisp process  may become unresponsive or simply terminate
execution without allowing the user to save current state. For this reason, most function
calls under CMIO involve a <em>safe evaluation</em>, in which errors are reported but not

<h2>Display Pages</h2>

Each source or target choice is represented as a "page" in the
window.  data fields on each page can be set in the GUI and also
initialized by passing the appropriate values to the function when the
window is created.
