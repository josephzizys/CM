<h1>Overview:<br/>The Console Window</h1>

<p>

The Console window is the "main window" for Grace; there is only one
Console and closing it will quit the application.  The main purpose of
the Console is to show text messages produced by executing SAL or Lisp
statements (see also: <a href="#lisp_menu">The Lisp Menu</a> and <a href="editor.html">The Grace Editor</a>) and
to display errors and warnings produced by Grace commands.

</p>

<h2 id="console_themes">Console Themes</h2>

<p>The appearance of the Console can be customized by applying "color
themes" to it. A number of different themes are available under the
<span class="menuitem">View&gt;Themes</span> sub menu. In general, a
theme controls the Console's background color and the color of
"normal" output text. A few special types of messages have a
consistent appearance across all themes:

<span style="font-size:large;">
<ul>
  <li><span class="graceerror">Error/fail messages are red</span></li>
  <li><span class="gracewarning">Warning messages are orange</span></li>  
  <li><span class="gracevalues">Return/success values are green</span></li>  
</ul>
</span>

<h2 id="lisp_menu">The Lisp Menu</h2>

<p>The Lisp menu allows you configure, start, stop and customize
aspects of a Lisp session. In order to start Lisp several requirements
must be met:</p>

<ul>

<li>You must have a recent version of either <a
href="http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html">SBCL</a>, <a
href="http://openmcl.clozure.com/Distributions/index.html">OpenMCL</a>
or <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1355">CLisp</a>
installed on your machine, and you must know where the executable
resides. If you have installed a binary version of Grace on Windows or
OS X then an executable is included under the Application's Resources
directory.</li>

<li>You should have a <em>Lisp systems directory</em> that contains,
at a minimum, the Grace runtime Lisp system (system file:
grace/grace.asd) and the Common Music system (system file:
cm/cm.asd). The Lisp systems directory is the parent directory that
Grace will use to find the various <A
href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf">ASDF</a> defined Lisp systems that
are compiled and loaded into a running Lisp session.  The Lisp system
directory can reside anywhere on your file system.  Since Lisp systems
are compiled at runtime, you must have write permission under this
directory.  If you have installed a binary version of Grace on Windows
or OS X the Lisp systems directory is included under the Resources
directory of the application.</li> </ul>

<h3>Configuring Lisp</h3>

<p>Use the <span class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Configure Lisp...</span>
 dialog window to specify the information that is required to start a
 Lisp session. Here is an explanation of the various fields of this
 dialog:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The Host field allows you to specify the computer that will act
  as the "Lisp server" that Grace will connect to and communicate
  with. Currently this field "read only" and is set to
  <code>localhost</code>, i.e. the physical machine you are
  using.</li>
  
  <li>The Port field allows you to specify the port (socket) number
  that will be used to communicate with Lisp once the Lisp server has
  started running. The port number can be any value above
  1024. Normally there is no reason to change the default port
  value. However, if you have already attempted to start Lisp and
  failed you might bump this number to insure that a new port will be
  used for the next connection.</li>

<li>The radio buttons allow you to select the Lisp implementation that
you will use during the Lisp session. When you select one of the
implementations, the default path to that lisp's executable will be
displayed in the associated typein field. If the background color of
this field is red it means that Grace cannot find the listed
executable. In this case you should type the pathname to the
executable by hand and press Enter to select it.</li>

<li>Use the Lisp Systems Directory field to specify the pathname to
the directory on your machine that contains the Grace runtime system
(definition file: grace/grace.asd) and Common Music (definition file:
cm/cm.asd). Since Lisp systems get compiled when they are loaded, you
must have write permission in the various sub directories of the Lisp
Systems Directory.  Add any Lisp ASDF system you want to this
directory for easy access and loading.</li> </ul>
<h3>Starting and Stopping Lisp</h3>

<p>If the <span class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Start Lisp</span> item is
active select it to start a Lisp session. If it is not active then
use <span class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Configure Lisp...</span>  to
configure the session so that it can be started. If <span
class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Stop Lisp</span> is available use it to kill
the current (running) Lisp session.</p>

<p>Once Lisp is running the Console window will display any output
that results from the Lisp session. Note that the Console window is
<em>not</em> a Lisp REPL (this is a feature not a bug); to evaluate
Lisp expressions or execute SAL code open a new Editor window and
enter your code there. Then: </p>

<ul>
  
<li>To execute SAL commands, place the cursor at the end of the
Command and press <span class="emacscmd">COMMAND-Enter</span>, or use the <span
class="menuitem">SAL&gt;Execute Command</span> item.</li> <li>To
evaluate a Lisp expression, place the cursor just after the expr and
type <span class="emacscmd">COMMAND-E</span> (or <span class="emacscmd">C-xC-e</span> if Emacs mode is enabled) or use the <span
class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Eval Expr</span> item.</li>

</ul>
