<h1>Overview:<br/>The Console Window</h1>

<p>

The Console window serves as the main window for Grace: there is only
one Console window and closing it will quit the application.  The
purpose of the Console is to display messages, errors and warndings
produced by Grace commands. It also serves as standard ouput for Lisp.

</p>

<h2 id="color_themes">Colort Themes</h2>

<p>The appearance of the Console can be customized by applying color
themes to it. A number of different themes are available under the
<span class="menuitem">View&gt;Themes</span> sub menu. In general, a
theme controls the Console's background color and the color of normal
output text.</p>
<p> A few special types of messages have a consistent
appearance across all themes: </p>

<span style="font-size:large;">
<ul>
  <li><span class="graceerror">Error/fail messages (red)</span></li>
  <li><span class="gracewarning">Warning messages (orange)</span></li>  
  <li><span class="gracevalues">Return/success values (green)</span></li>  
</ul>
</span>

<h2 id="lisp_menu">The Lisp Menu</h2>

<p>The Lisp menu allows you configure, start, stop and customize
aspects of a Lisp session.</p>




<h3 id="configure_lisp_dialog">Configure Lisp Dialog</h3>

<p>Use the <span class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Configure Lisp...</span>
 dialog window to specify the information that is required to start a
 Lisp session. Here is an explanation of the various fields of this
 dialog:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The Host field allows you to specify the computer that will act
  as the "Lisp server" that Grace will connect to and communicate
  with. Currently this field "read only" and is set to
  <code>localhost</code>, i.e. the physical machine you are
  using.</li>
  
  <li>The Port field allows you to specify the port (socket) number
  that will be used to communicate with Lisp once the Lisp server has
  started running. The port number can be any value above
  1024. Normally there is no reason to change the default port
  value. However, if you have already attempted to start Lisp and
  failed you might bump this number to insure that a new port will be
  used for the next connection.</li>

<li>The radio buttons allow you to select the Lisp implementation that
you will use during the Lisp session. Grace supports either <a
href="http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html">SBCL</a> or <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1355">CLisp</a>. When
you select one of the implementations, the default path to that lisp's
executable will be displayed in the typein field.  If the default
location is not correct (or if none is supplied) then either type the
absolute pathanme to the exectuabtle or use the browse button next to
it to locate the executable using a Find File dialog.</li>

<li>The ASDF Systems Directory field contains the pathname to the
directory on your machine where you store the various Lisp systems you
work with. Add any Lisp ASDF system you want to this directory for
easy access and loading. Since ASDF systems get compiled when they are
loaded, you must have write permission in these directories. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Starting and Stopping Lisp</h3>

<p>If the <span class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Start Lisp</span> item is
active select it to start a Lisp session. If it is not active then use
<span class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Configure Lisp...</span> to configure
the session so that it can be started. If <span
class="menuitem">Lisp&gt;Stop Lisp</span> is available you can use it
to kill the running Lisp session.</p>

<p>Grace will print information as it attempts to start your Lisp and
establish a socket connection with it. If the connection is successful
your Lisp session is ready to go. If the connection is not successful
then use the Configure Lisp dialog to fix the problem and use Start
Lisp again to attempt another connection.</p>

<p>Once Lisp is running the Console window will display output that
results from the Lisp session. Note that the Console window is not a
Lisp REPL (this is a feature not a bug): to evaluate Lisp or SAL code
open a new Editor window and enter your code there. Then place your
cursor at the end of the text to execute and press <span
class="emacscmd">COMMAND-Enter</span>, or use the <span
class="menuitem">Execute</span> menu item under the SAL or Lisp
menu.</li>

</ul>
