<h1>Overview:<br/>The Console Window</h1>

<p>The Console window is used by Grace commands to display, or return,
text information back to the user. The Console is the "main window"
for Grace and closing it will quit the application.</a>

<h2>Color Themes</h2>

<p>The appearance of the Console can be customized by applying various
"color themes" to it. A number of different color themes are available
under the View&gt;Themes sub menu. In general, a theme controls the
Console's background color and the color of "normal" output text. A
few special types of messages have a consistent appearance across all
themes:

<span style="font-size:large;">
<ul>
  <li><span class="graceerror">Error messages are red</span></li>
  <li><span class="gracewarning">Warning messages are orange</span></li>  
  <li><span class="gracevalues">Return values are green</span></li>  
</ul>
</span>

<h2>The Lisp Menu</h2>

<p>The Lisp menu allows you configure, start, stop and customize
aspects of a Lisp session. In order to start Lisp several requirements
must be met:</p>

<ul>

<li>You must have a recent version of either <a
href="http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html">SBCL</a>, <a
href="http://openmcl.clozure.com/Distributions/index.html">OpenMCL</a>
or <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1355">CLisp</a>
installed on your machine, and you must know where the executable
resides. If you have installed a binary version of Grace on Windows or
OS X then an executable is included under the Application's Resources
directory.</li>

<li>You must have a Lisp systems directory that contains, at a
minimum, the Grace runtime Lisp system (system file: grace/grace.asd)
and the Common Music system (system file: cm/cm.asd). The Lisp systems
directory is the (parent) directory that will contain the various <A
href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf">ASDF</a> defined Lisp systems that
you want Grace to compile and load for you. The Lisp system directory
can reside anywhere on your file system but, since Lisp systems are
compiled at runtime, you must have write permission in all
sub directories of this directory.  If you have installed a binary
version of Grace on Windows or OS X the Lisp systems directory is
included under the Resources directory of the application.</li> </ul>


<h3>Starting and Stopping Lisp</h3>

<p>If the Lisp&gt;Start Lisp item is active select it it to start a
Lisp session. If it is not active then use the Lisp&gt;Configure Lisp
item to configure the session so that it can be started. If
Lisp&gt;Stop Lisp is available use it to kill the current (running)
Lisp session.</p>

<p>Once Lisp is running the Console window will display any output
that results from the Lisp session. Note that the Console window is
<em>not</em> a Lisp REPL (this is a feature not a bug); to evaluate
Lisp expressions or execute SAL code open a new Editor window and
enter your code there. Then: </p>

<ul>
  
<li>To execute SAL commands, place the cursor at the end of the
Command and press COMMAND-Enter, or use the SAL&gt;Execute Command
item.</li> <li>To evaluate a Lisp expression, place the cursor just
after the expr and type COMMAND-E (or C-x C-e if Emacs mode is
enabled) or use the LISP&gt;Eval Expr item.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Configuring Lisp</h3>

<p>Use Lisp&gt;Configure Lisp to open a dialog window to specify the
 information that is required before a Lisp session can be
 started. Here is an explanation of the various fields that appear in
 this dialog:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The Host field allows you to specify the computer that will act
  as the "Lisp server" that Grace will connect to and communicate
  with. Currently this field "read only" and is set to
  <code>localhost</code>, i.e. the physical machine you are
  using.</li>
  
  <li>The Port field allows you to specify the port (socket) number
  that will be used to communicate with Lisp once the Lisp server has
  started running. The port number can be any value above
  1024. Normally there is no reason to change the default port
  value. However, if you have already attempted to start Lisp and
  failed you might bump this number to insure that a new port will be
  used for the next connection.</li>

<li>The radio buttons allow you to select the Lisp implementation that
you will use during the Lisp session. When you select one of the
implementations, the default path to that lisp's executable will be
displayed in the associated typein field. If the background color of
this field is red it means that Grace cannot find the listed
executable. In this case you should type the pathname to the
executable by hand and press Enter to select it.</li>

<li>Use the Lisp Systems Directory field to specify the pathname to
the directory on your machine that contains the Grace runtime system
(definition file: grace/grace.asd) and Common Music (definition file:
cm/cm.asd). Since Lisp systems get compiled when they are loaded, you
must have write permission in the various sub directories of the Lisp
Systems Directory.  Add any Lisp ASDF system you want to this
directory for easy access and loading.</li> </ul>
